# odin-recipes
Iteration 1: Initial Structure
Create an index.html file within the odin-recipes directory.
Fill it with the standard HTML boilerplate.
Add an <h1> heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.
Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Inside the recipes directory, create a new HTML file named after the recipe it will contain (e.g., lasagna.html).
Add an <h1> heading with the recipe's name as its content to the new recipe page.
In the index.html file, create a link to the recipe page you just created using the following format:
html
Copy code
<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>
Replace recipename.html with the actual filename and "Recipe Title" with the name of the recipe.
Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Your new recipe page should have the following content:

An image of the finished dish under the <h1> heading.
A properly sized "Description" heading followed by a paragraph describing the recipe.
An "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
A "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.
Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Add two more recipes with the same page structure as the recipe page you've already created.
Don't forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Consider organizing the links in an unordered list for better readability.
Enjoy creating and sharing your favorite recipes with Odin Recipes!
