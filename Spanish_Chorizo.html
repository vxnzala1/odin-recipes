  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Spanish chorizo stuffed chicken breast is a prime example of my successful attempts in making boneless 
    skinless chicken breast less boringâ€”one foolproof thing is stuffing it with sausage.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ingredient 1: 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>Ingredient 2:2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>Ingredient 3:1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (optional)</li>
    <li>Ingredient 4:2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts (8 to 10 ounces each)</li>
    <li>Ingredient 5:2 ounces Spanish chorizo sausage, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Ingredient 6:salt to taste</li>
    <li>Ingredient 7:2 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>Ingredient 8:2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>Ingredient 9:2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
    <li>Ingredient 10:1/3 cup sherry wine</li>
    <li>Ingredient 11:2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
    <li>Ingredient 12:freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Ingredient 13:1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Mix olive oil, garlic, and oregano in a small bowl and setaside.</li>
    

    <li>Step 2: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).

    <li>Step 3: Use a sharp thin knife to make five deep slashes at a 45-degree angle into the chicken breast, about an inch apart, 
        going almost, but not quite all the way through.  Leave about 1/2-inch of breast un-cut on either side of the slash.</li>

    <li>Step 4: Salt chicken breasts generously on both sides, and spoon oil mixture on top. Rub olive oil mixture into slashes, 
        and all over the surface and bottom of the breasts.</li>

    <li>Step 5: Slide slices of chorizo into the slashes in the chicken. Once inserted, at least 75% of the sausage slice should be 
        covered by chicken.</li>

    <li>Step 6: Transfer chicken to an oven safe skillet or pan, and pour over any extra oil. Dust breasts with breadcrumbs, 
        and sprinkle with cheese.</li>

    <li>Step 7: Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
        inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
    </li>Step 8:Remove chicken from pan, and let rest on plate, loosely covered with foil.</li>

    <li>Step 9: Add vinegar and sherry to the pan and turn the heat to medium high. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil, 
    stirring occasionally. Cook until sauce has reduced by half.</li>

    <li>Step 10: Add any accumulated juices from the plate of chicken to the pan. Reduce heat to lowest setting and stir in cold butter. 
    </li>Step 11: Stir constantly until butter has disappeared.</li>
    </li>Step 12: Turn off heat, and stir in the parsley. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.</li>
    </li>Step 13: Transfer chicken to plates and top with sauce.</li>
  </ol>
