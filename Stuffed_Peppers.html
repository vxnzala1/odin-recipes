  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    
    <li>Step 2: Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer 
      until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>

    <li>Step 3: Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until 
      evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>

    <li>Step 4:Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. 
      Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>

    <li>Step 5: Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>

    <li>Step 6: Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, 
      Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling 
      into each hollowed pepper.</li>

    <li>Step 7: Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>

    <li>Step 8: Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>

    <li>Step 9: Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
